Greetings! It's Hamilton. I hope this update finds you and your loved ones safe and well. 

This page contains two short videos describing some changes that I'll be making to my academic support operations for the Fall 2020 semester. Please watch them at your convenience as you prepare for the coming school year!

### Two Important Changes

In this video, I briefly describe the two exciting changes for academic support this year:

1. 100% Remote Sessions with Students: Safer + Better = Awesome
2. Automated, Streamlined Scheduling with Appointlet

### Session Types and Scheduling with Appointlet

In this video, I describe the two types of sessions I'll be offering this year:

1. Single Sessions
2. Weekly Sessions

I also be demonstrating how you can use Appointlet to easily check when I'm available, book a new session, or reschedule/cancel an existing schedule - all on your own time, without having to wait to hear back from me.

You can check out my Appointlet page [here](http://hamilton.appointlet.com)!

### Scheduling Policies

In the second video, I described the rules that Appointlet will be using for booking, rescheduling, and cancelling sessions. Please take a look before you start booking sessions with me:

### Closing Thoughts

2020 has obviously been an incredibly tumultuous year so far, but the educational show must go on. If you believe that academic support would help you or your child enjoy a more successful fall semester, please reach out so that we can discuss your situation and find a solution.

Sincerely,<br>
Hamilton
